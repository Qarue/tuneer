1. Plan before implementing.
Outline goals, data flow, components, states, and edge cases. Note assumptions and constraints.

1. Deliver a modern, responsive UI.
Mobile-first, fluid layouts, sensible breakpoints, and accessible interactions (keyboard + screen reader).

1. Write clean, maintainable code.
Use clear naming, small reusable modules, comments where intent isn’t obvious, and follow project lint/format rules.

1. Optimize layout density.
Use space efficiently: no gratuitous whitespace, but never cramped. Prefer information-dense views with consistent spacing scale. Minimize scrolling via grouping, tabs, or pagination; allow scrolling when it improves readability.
